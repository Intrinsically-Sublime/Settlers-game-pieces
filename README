---Description---

3D game pieces.

This is an accessory to be used with your Settlers of Catan game.

The tiles are 90mm across the diagonal of the hex. (same as originals)
The smaller hex tiles numbers/markers/houses/castles/etc are 31.6mm across the diagonal. (larger than originals)

I have included two styles of settlements/cities.
1) city/settlement; same as original except on a hex base.
2) house/castle; custom and with lots of detail

(caution high polygon count)
(rendering of complete game has 194150 vertices and 350881 facets)
